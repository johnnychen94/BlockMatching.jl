# BlockMatching

`BlockMatching` aims to provide a sophisticated implementation on common [block matching
algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-matching_algorithm) for image processing and
computer vision tasks. Block matching is a data and computational intense algorithm, performance is
of high priority for this package.

ðŸš§ This is still a WIP project.
